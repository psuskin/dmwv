The focus is on the realization of a health-promoting lifestyle using individual resources, competence and personal responsibility in the sense of applied prevention or \"integrated health promotion\". Therapeutic measures for the desired balance of individual factors and needs as well as for the realization of subjective health, salutogenesis and well-being are usually offered in professional medical wellness centers, clinics or hotel-like facilities in cooperation with corresponding medically managed and scientifically based therapy departments."
